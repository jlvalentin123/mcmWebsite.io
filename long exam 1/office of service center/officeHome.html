   <p> Nothing is more empowering than being able to harness one’s talents and skills for the betterment of the community. </p>
   <p> At Malayan Colleges Mindanao (MCM), the spirit of volunteerism and civic consciousness among students, faculty, and staff are fostered through the active participation in activities organized by the Center for Service-Learning and Community Engagement (CSCE). The CSCE provides an avenue for students, employees and members of its immediate community to take part in the school’s mission of providing state-of-the-art solutions to problems of industries and communities  locally and beyond. The goal of the department is to support activities that enhance and serve communities and address issues that impact the quality of life. </p>
   <p> <b>Supported Activities: </b> </p>
   <p> ►  Volunteerism</p>
   <p> ►  Community Outreach </p>
   <p> ►  Service-Learning Initiatives</p>
