<p> With a whizzy wisk of tech, </p>
<p> Or a dash of skills and care, </p>
<p> A masterly stroke of art, </p>
<p> We help advance man’s welfare; </p>
<p> ‘Tis our human part. </p>
<p> We all say, “All hands on deck, </p>
<p> O’ there at the frontlines, Malayan. </p>
<p> O’ here in our hearts and in our minds, </p>
<p> Malayan!” </p>

<p> As we do our very best, </p>

  <p> The Malayan Hymn is the college hymn of Malayan Colleges Laguna and Malayan High School of Science, a private, non-sectarian, and wholly owned subsidiary of Mapúa Institute of Technology along with the other subsidiaries like the Mapúa IT Center in Makati City. </p>
  <p> The hymn was written by Dr. Reynaldo B. Vea and the melody for the song was written by Joel Navarro. </p>
  <p> It was written and published in 2007, and performed by the Malayan Colleges Laguna Chamber Choir. </p>
  <p>The hymn represents the totality of Malayan education in the Philippines that is exhibited through the establishment of Malayan Colleges Laguna and Malayan Colleges Mindanao after the construction of the two leading academic frontiers: Mapúa Institute of Technology and Malayan High School of Science. The hymn relays Malayan Colleges Mindanao as a sentry of quality, academic rigor and integrity not just in the field of science, technology and engineering, but also in arts, humanities and social sciences. </p>
  <p> The Malayan Hymn also depicts a challenge for learners and facilitators to learn to live by the name of the institution which highlights the importance of bearing the name of excellence and relevance in Mindanao. </p>
