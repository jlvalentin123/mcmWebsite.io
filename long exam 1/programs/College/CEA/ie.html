    <b> <h3> INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING PROGRAM </h3> </b>
    <p> Industrial Engineering program focuses on the optimal mastery of the complex processes in crafting, improving, and installing products and integrated systems of people, information, equipment, and energy. </p>
    <p> With outcomes-based education, it gears up learnerâ€™s knowledge and competencies in Mathematics, physical and social sciences in conjunction with the principles and methods of engineering analysis and design to empirically assess outcomes from varied systems. Also, the program advances learners to potentially establish iron-like foundation in both manufacturing and service industries. This hones learners to qualify in the local and global standards in the field of industrial engineering.
